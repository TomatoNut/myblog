Today, I created an Arduino Bar graph using a row of 8 LEDs controlled controlled by a potentiometer. The analog input is achieved by turning the potentiometer, and depending on the direction of the turn, the LEDs light up or turn off one at a time in sequence.

components used:
- Ardunio UNO
- breadboard
- jumper wires
- 10k-ohm potentiometer
- 8 LEDs
- 8 220-ohm resistors

code used:
